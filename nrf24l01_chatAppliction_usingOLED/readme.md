**NRF24L01 Based Chat Application Using OLED**

    In this example we are using NRF24L01 radio and Arduino to
    communicate with other Arduino and NRF24L01 using OLED display.
    Here we are creating a local mesh between two radios(NRF24L01)
    using <RF24.h> and <RF24Network.h library>. For OLED we are using
    <Adafruit_GFX.h> and <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> libraries.
    For every new message buzzer will alert user and message will be 
    diplayed on OLED.
