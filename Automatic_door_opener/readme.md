**Automatic Garrage Door Opener**
  
  This example uses a motion-detecting sensor (PIR sensor) to open or close the door which detects the infrared energy omitted from human's body. 
  When someone comes in front of the door, the infrared energy detected by the sensor changes and it triggers the sensor to open the door whenever
  someone approaches the door. The signal is further sent to arduino uno that controls servo motors which are attached to the the door.
